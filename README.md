SO. The Monkey. Holy wow, where do I even— there’s still butter on my fingers from the popcorn, the kind that will oil up my phone screen for weeks I swear. Just out of the theater, the buzzing, glittering lights still in my eyes, a bunch of people everywhere, like a flock of crows scattered in a field but way more loud. Can barely piece it all together.

It's like— imagine if Wes Anderson designed a zoo but like, while he was sitting on a roller coaster, holding on for dear life. The colors, they were like an IKEA catalog left out in the rain, you know? Just, running together in stripes that don’t make sense but also just kind of... work. The set design felt like a madcap dream you'd have falling asleep on a couch you designed yourself, where none of the cushions matched and the coffee table was from a garage sale.

> And get this. So a talking monkey. Yeah, it’s in the title, duh, but this monkey don’t just talk. Its voice was like old vinyl records, just a bit scratchy, a bit magical. Some scenes it was Hamlet and in others it was like if Kramer from Seinfeld tried interpretive dance. That's not a mixed metaphor. Or maybe it is, who even knows? And then halfway through, I thought I left my phone at home and freaked out and that’s when the monkey started singing. Next-level stuff.

Characters moving through rooms like living puzzles, every inch injected with this palpable energy—like a sandwich blendered into paint and put up on a wall. Maybe you should download the movie when it’s out? Not just for the monkey’s monologues but for the geography of nonsense. 

One scene had this insane wallpaper that was almost like staring straight into one of those magic eye things that split into menus of memories. Leaves rustling, whispering secrets, while I shift uncomfortably in the cheap seats, my back reminding me I'm not an architect for chairs. Must remember to watch the movie again (should anybody remind me of this rollercoaster collision).

Dash of fragrance like socks left in the sun, and then the monkey’s existential crisis over a banana peel that sold me entirely. Who writes this stuff? It’s like Sylvia Plath woke up in a Pixar dream. Download it if you can. It’s a kaleidoscope masquerading as a film.

function forgetEverything() {
   let memories = [ ];
   memories.push('still there somehow');
   console.log('Am I still typing');
} 

Rain-check on logic, it’s out on space-leave duty.
